# The owner(s) will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
# Users must have explicit 'write' access to the repository to be a codeowner.
# A user can be referred by a username or by an email address that has been added to their account.
#
# Order is important! The last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs directory at the root of the repository and any of its subdirectories.
# /build/logs/ @doctocat
#
# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
# docs/* docs@example.com
#
# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory anywhere in your repository.
# apps/ @octocat
#
# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs` directory in the root of your repository and any of its subdirectories.
# /docs/ @doctocat
# 
# In this example, any change inside the `/scripts` directory will require approval from @doctocat or @octocat.
# /scripts/ @doctocat @octocat
# 
# In this example, @octocat owns any file in a `/logs` directory such as `/build/logs`, `/scripts/logs`, and `/deeply/nested/logs`. Any changes in a `/logs` directory will require approval from @octocat.
# **/logs @octocat
# 
# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps` directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github` subdirectory, as its owners are left empty. Without an owner, changes to `apps/github` can be made with the approval of any user who has write access to the repository.
# /apps/ @octocat
# /apps/github
# 
# In this example, @octocat owns any file in the `/apps` directory in the root of your repository except for the `/apps/github` subdirectory, as this subdirectory has its own owner @doctocat
# /apps/ @octocat
# /apps/github @doctocat
