In the [wall-of-shame](https://github.com/OneWomanLess/OneWomanLess.github.io/tree/main/wall-of-shame) directory, we gather information about projects and spaces which actively contributed to the issues, making pressure on them to reconsider their behaviours/culture and find ways to compensate and reconcile with those who got harmed by them, if they want to be removed from the list.

The list can also be used as a list of places that are not safe and should rather be avoided by women/any minority members.

Currently the `wall-of-shame` has been removed from the project.

I guess they probably learn on us, and it usually happens once in a project's/person's life.

With current power-imbalances it seems to me there may be more people hesitating to support the project because of conflicts of interests or other reasons than those who'd be courage enough to support it as it is.
